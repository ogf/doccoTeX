**DoccoTeX** is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long,
literate-programming-style documentation generator completely based on
[Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/). Instead of generating a
beautiful HTML report it generates a not so pretty LaTeX file to be
included in your main document.

For more information, see the result of applying **DoccoTeX** to
itself:
